# react-redux-wp

### A Webpack build of React, with state managed by Redux.

## Explanation
* I used a React-Redux-Webpack framework to build a simple site where you can add posts, then upvote or downvote. 
* Redux stores the state of each posts' votes.
* Redux sorts posts by highest number of votes.

## Take Aways
* Webpack takes longer to build. But you learn how it works, unlike the mysterious workings of "create-react-app".
* I tried to build React, then Redux, which went horribly. In Redux applications it is best to write the state machine first.
