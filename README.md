# react-redux-wp

### A Webpack build of React, with state managed by Redux.

### Try it out at my [GithubPages](https://matthew-buchanan.github.io/react-redux-wp/)

## Explanation
* I used a React-Redux-Webpack framework to build a simple site where you can add posts, then upvote or downvote. 
* Redux stores the state of each posts' votes.
* Redux sorts posts by highest number of votes.
* React renders the components

## Take Aways
* "Create-react-app" is way faster than Webpack. Despite that I like that in Webpack, I set it up manually, so I know how it works.
* I started by building a ton of React components. Then I tried to write Redux. I got stuck. I started over and coded Redux first, and the rest of the project went smoothly.
